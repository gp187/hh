# HH Framework

## Goals

* 0 dependency routing
* all routes in 1 place
* type-safe controller execution


## Problem

I can't find a proper way to declare [here](https://gitlab.com/m0/hh/blob/master/app/Routes/api.hh) the Class/Function and execute them [here](https://gitlab.com/m0/hh/blob/master/framework/Http/Response.hh)

Note: the api declaration isn't meant to be saved anywhere. just the code there
